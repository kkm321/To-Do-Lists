To-Do-List

All code is written in Python.

Creates a to-do list with user input. The user will be prompted to create a list with five items that they need to do. Then the user will be prompted with options on editing/viewing said list.

The first one includes the options to:
  1. Add a task to the to-do list 
  2. View the current to-do list 
  3. Mark a task as completed 
  4. Remove a task from the to-do list 
  5. Exit the program

The second one includes the options to:
  1. Add a task to the to-do list 
  2. View the current to-do list 
  3. Mark a task as completed 
  4. Remove a task from the to-do list 
  5. Remove all tasks from the to-do list
  6. Sort the list alphabetically
  7. Count the # of Items on the To-do List
  8. Exit the program

The initial to-do list is a product of pair programming with Ngoc Nguyen, while the second is individual programming
